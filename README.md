This document outlines the linear regression analysis performed on the advertising dataset.

# Project Description


The project aims to understand the relationship between advertising spending across different media channels (TV, radio, newspaper) and sales.

By analyzing this relationship, the goal is to build a predictive model to estimate sales based on advertising expenditures.

# Dataset
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/advertising-dataset


Variables:
TV: Advertising spending on TV (in thousands of dollars)


Radio: Advertising spending on radio (in thousands of dollars)


Newspaper: Advertising spending on newspaper (in thousands of dollars)


Sales: Sales figures (in thousands of units)


Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, outlier treatment, and feature scaling were performed.
# Linear Regression Model


Model Type: Multiple Linear Regression


Model Equation: Sales = β0 + β1(TV) + β2(Radio) + β3(Newspaper) + ε


Model Description: Represents the linear relationship between advertising expenditures across different media channels and sales.


Model Training: The model was trained using the least squares method on the dataset.


Model Validation: The performance of the model was validated using metrics such as R-squared value and error metrics.
